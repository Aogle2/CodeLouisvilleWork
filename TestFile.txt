This is a test file using VIM and git cli

this is another part that I wanted to add to the file.

to get the repo on your computer:
git clone https://github.com/Aogle2/CodeLouisvilleWork.git


when you add content and need to commit it:
git commit -a -m "Adding all these things"

or

git commit TestFile.txt -m "THis one changed."


To finalize this process:

git push
